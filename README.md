This is a Composer-based installer for the [Islandora](https://github.com/islandora/documentation) Drupal distribution.

This project is used by the official installers that set up a virtual machine and deploy the full Islandora stack.

This project includes the 'standard' Islandora profile. Since otehr profiles vary widely in their dependencies, they should include their own composer project.

If installing manually, you can run 'composer install' as with any composer-based project.
